                                        <p>Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that
                                            control the state of the user program and control access to the controller’s
                                            API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the
                                            face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the
                                            controller’s API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are

                                        <p>Program modification encompasses the addition and modification of

                                            will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so
                                            adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use

                                        <p>Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to

                                            interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the

                                            the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their

                                            using credential access techniques. In some cases, default credentials for
                                            control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials
                                            may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts
                                            and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote
                                            systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary
                                            increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted

                                    Hooking <div class="mitre-matrix__table__td-detail">
                                        <p>Adversaries may hook into application programming interface (API) functions
                                            used by processes to redirect calls for execution and privilege escalation
                                            means. Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks
                                            that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically
                                            stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions.</p>
                                        <p>One type of hooking seen in ICS involves redirecting calls to these functions
                                            via import address table (IAT) hooking. IAT hooking uses modifications to a
                                            process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored.</p>

                                            in real time using man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This type of attack

                                            interface (API) to access system functions. Native APIs provide a controlled

                                            leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not

                                            Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in

                                            are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or

                                        <p>Adversaries may use scripting languages to execute arbitrary code in the form

                                            interpreter. Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from
                                            compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead
                                            of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code
                                            just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and
                                            every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software
                                            developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists.
                                            This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling
                                            executables for many different systems. … &lt;abridged&gt;</p>

                                            communications and unauthorized access to a wireless network. Access to a
                                            wireless network may be gained through the compromise of a wireless device.
                                            Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices
                                            on the same frequency as the wireless network. Wireless compromise can be
                                            done as an initial access vector from a remote distance.</p>
